## Foodie. Explorer. Wannabe photographer. Coffee drinker by day, midnight snacker by night...

Jennie dabbles in everything fun and creative. She's social media marketing intern to [Jetsetter Jobs][0], promoting the brand as she shares her love for travel and bright personality with thousands of internetters. As Art Director for UCL RUMS Review magazine's advertising campaign, she carries only the catchiest and quirkiest concepts from ideas on paper to real impact. Her love for beauty, fashion, food and travel are brought to life on her blog, [J'Story][1].

In her spare time (of which she has too much) she eats too many almond croissants, window shops up and down Oxford Street and dances by herself to the latest hits. Her one wish is to have an apartment with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the city -- oh, and the perfect minimalist wardrobe. Old historic towns, cobbled streets and salty sea breezes make her weak in the knees.
She's a girl with an unending imagination and more often than not she's sitting in a quaint little coffee shop somewhere, busy daydreaming big.
